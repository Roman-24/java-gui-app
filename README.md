# Tea Suits â€“ Luxury Suit Manufacturing

## Program Description
This is a boutique/tailoring shop aimed at producing luxury suits on demand. The goal of my program is to create a system for managing orders and representing certain production processes. The main point of the system is that there are individual users who log into the system, and depending on their role, they can perform different actions within the system.

### Manager
The manager can add orders to the system, view all orders, delete orders, and display the current number of orders in the system.

### Designer
The designer can view all orders and assign a specific design to an order by entering its order number.

### Tailor
The tailor represents certain manufacturing processes, specifically five production steps, which can be performed on individual orders. The system tracks these changes and ensures that the production steps are completed in the correct order.
